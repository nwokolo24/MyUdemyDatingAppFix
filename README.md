# MyUdemyDatingAppFix

# The folders in this repo, contain the correct codes that helps with the error you may be having with installing the right npm packages with regards to DatingApp from Udemy. They are my findings as a result of taking the Udemy Course on 'Build an app with ASPNET Core and Angular form Scratch' by Neil.  Feel free to ask questions if they're not clear enough.

# -- If you are getting the "export 'Renderer' was not found in '@angular/core'" replace "ngx-gallery" folder in "node_module" with the "ngx-gallery" in this repo

# -- If you are not able to import "NgxSpinnerModule" in app.module.ts because NgxSpinnerModule is not exported in ngx-spinner, go ahead and replace the "ngx-spinner" folder in "node_module" with the "ngx-spinner" folder in this repo and that should take care of the error.
